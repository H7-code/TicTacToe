# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbol, either 'X' or 'O'. The goal is to align three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. This project brings the game to life with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Streamlit**. The game also features varying difficulty levels for a more dynamic experience: **Practice**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.
